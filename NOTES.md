## Day 1
Wednesday, August 15, 2018

### 0.19.0 Changes
* _Union Types_ are now referred to as _Custom Types_

### Reasons to use Elm
* fast & reliable (no runtime exceptions)
* hiring is easier & quality of candidates is high
* cohesive ecosystem

### QUESTIONS
* Source maps for Elm?
  * Not needed as much because you don't need to debug runtime errors
* Reasons for differences in syntax
  * e.g. -- vs // for comments, whitespace instead of parens, commas at beginning of lines

### COMMENTS
* Elm slack - there is a Minneapolis room
* Good idea bringing TypeScript in for comparison
